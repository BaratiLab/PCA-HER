# PCA-HER
Based on OpenAI's baselines, a novel reinforcement learning methodology, PCA-HER is proposed for faster learning of the traditional HER with DDPG algorithm. This is achieved by extracting High Value Transitions (HVTs) from the Experience Replay Buffer in Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to create the most important transitions for learning.

Note: PCA-HER is referred to as "der" in the code.
